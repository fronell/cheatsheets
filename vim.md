# Buffers
```
:bn       | Go to next buffer
:bp       | Go to previous buffer

:1,$bd    | Delete all buffers
:Bd       | Delete a buffer without closing window using Bbye plugin
:Bdelete  | Close all open buffers but leave windows intact
```

# Copy and Pasting
```
:"0P    | Paste in last yanked text in front of cursor position

## fugitive
Reference: http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim-exploring-the-history-of-a-git-repository/
The screencast uses an older version of Fugitive with a different command syntax
but its still very relevant.
```
:G                  | git status in split that supports syntax operations such
                      as ]] to jump to next section or = to show changes
g?                  | Show available fugitive commands
:G log -- %         | Show entire commit history for file in current window
:G log -p -10 -- %  | Sow changes from last 10 commits in patch format
:G log -Sword -- %  | Search history of changes for file in current window
:Gvdiffsplit        | Opens vsplit diff between staged and working tree versions
:Gvdiffsplit!       | Does the above and maintain focus on current window
:G difftool -y      | Open new tab with diff splits for each file with a change
:Gread              | Git checkout file into buffer (does not modify git repo)
:Gvsplit HEAD~#:%   | Open file in current window from # commits ago in vsplit
```
## pt (The Platinum Searcher)
**IMPORTANT** Note: pt will skip binary files by default.  I found that **files
in the dos format are considered binary** by these tools and the fix is to
convert them to unix format using a tool such as dos2unix (or vim).  dos2unix
can be used to show if a file is in dos format by issuing the following
command:  
`dos2unix -ic *`  
Any text file listed is in dos format and needs to be converted so it can be
searched.   
**IMPORTANT** Note: pt for whatever reason **does not support a wildcard in the
path argument on Windows.**  For example, the following command will work on
Windows:
`pt {pattern} c:\cloud`
However, the following does not work:
`Pt {pattern} c:\cloud\*.txt`
To limit searches to a specific file extension, add the \G regex filename filter
option like so:
`Pt /G \.txt$ {pattern} c:\cloud`
```
:Pt [options] {pattern} [{directories}]   | Opens file if pattern found
:Pt! [options] {pattern} [{directories}]  | Does not open file if pattern found
:Pt! /G \.txt$ {pattern} c:\cloud\        | Workaround for Windows to limit a
                                            search to files ending in .txt
```
### pt Quickfix Window Commands
```
o   | Open (same as enter)
O   | Open and close quickfix window
go  | Preview file (open but maintain focus on ack.vim results)
t   | Open in new tab
T   | Open in new tab silently

H   | Open in horizontal split silently
v   | Open in vertical split
